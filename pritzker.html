The Pritzker Architecture Prize is awarded annually "to honor a living architect or architects whose built work demonstrates a combination of those qualities of talent, vision and commitment, which has produced consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment through the art of architecture."[1] Founded in 1979 by Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy, the award is funded by the Pritzker family and sponsored by the Hyatt Foundation and is considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes;[2] it is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.[3][4][5] The most recent winner, in 2016, is the Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena.

The prize is said to be awarded "irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology."[6] The recipients receive US$100,000, a citation certificate, and since 1987, a bronze medallion.[7] The designs on the medal are inspired by the work of architect Louis Sullivan, while the Latin inspired inscription on the reverse of the medallion—firmitas, utilitas, venustas (English: firmness, commodity and delight)—is from Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius.[8] Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture accompanied the monetary prize.[7]
